    "Day 456 - Wagner came back from the dig site very excited today. It seems he found something while digging for core samples in the ice. I await the specimen for study. It's likely nothing interesting.",
    
    "Day 457 - Autopsy Report: The specimen, which I cannot name at present, is not a match to anything I have ever before seen in my travels or studies. No terms produce results when searched. Whatever it is, its organs are quite different from ours. I can't even fathom their purpose.",
    
    "Day 461 - I don't think it's dead. At least, not in any way I can quantify as likely. The cells regenerate far too fast to be anything less than miraculous, and no amount of damage seems to fully eradicate them. I'm in awe of this lifeform.",
    
    "Day 462 - I didn't do the thing they say I did. That dog wasn't from me. I think...it...did it. In any case, I can't locate the corpse. It vanished. Then it autopsied the dog like I did to it. I hope it left. I really, really do.",
    
    "Day 469 - I've been locked in here for days now. Almost out of food. And I think I may be food myself fairly soon. The leftover specimen, a few cells at the time, is now moving around like some sort of freakish worm. It gets larger by the hour. I don't know what to do. The only thing left is to freeze it again.",
    
    "Day 470 - I'd frozen the specimen and all was well. And then Wagner returned from his expedition beyond the mountain. And he brought more of...them. There's nothing I can do now but try the wards I've been getting in my head. I'll need blood. Simmons will do. He's infected anyway."
