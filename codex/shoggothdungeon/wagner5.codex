"I keep having this dream, and in it I am some sort of barrel-shaped creature. Around me are vast, cyclopean ruins etched with bizarre carvings. I can hear this constant sound, like a wet slap or suction. And behind it all, a strange sound...TEKELI-LI!",
"It plays like some fell flute on the wind. I wander in this strange body, towards the sound. In my...whatever passes for a hand...I hold some strange weapon or tool. And then I see it, rising from a black bit like some sort of sentient vomit plastered with a thousand visages undulating beneath the skin. Rather than run in fear, I stab at it with the device. There is a flash, and then I am awake.",
"Ten nights in a row I've been burdened with this strangeness. Ten nights I've woken up in a cold sweat swearing that I can hear voices in the night, musical voices whispering like some sort of conscience in the back of my mind. Yet I saw nothing. Not until tonight.",
"They were outside of our camp, well beyond the sight of us due in part to the blizzard-like conditions. I was outside trying to solve the quandry with the drill when the whispers started. Frantically, I looked around for their source but could find none. I'd thought I was truly losing my mind until I noticed movement.",
"It was there, swirling its bizarre limbs about, barely noticable in the storm. I could sense it, perhaps because of my dreams...and I knew in that moment that it intended nothing good for us. As I turned to call for the others there was a shift of limb and barrel-like body...and it was gone.",
"The others won't believe me, so I opted to simply leave and investigate on my own. Besides, MacReady has clearly lost it. I'd rather not be around when he totally snaps. If I find anything interesting I'll report back.",
"Well, I made it beyond the cliffs and am now staring directly at the ruins from my dream. It's covered in ice and snow, and the details are obscured but there is no mistaking it. What does this mean? Am I being called to find this place? By whom? I simply must know more. I will begin investigation in the morning."
